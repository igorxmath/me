# Creatine monohydrate

The most effective nutritional supplement available to athletes to increase high intensity exercise capacity and muscle mass during training is creatine monohydrate. 
Numerous studies have indicated that creatine supplementation increases body mass and/or muscle mass during training. 
Body mass increases are typically one to two kilograms greater than controls during 4–12 weeks of training. 
The gains in muscle mass appear to be a result of an improved ability to perform high intensity exercise enabling an athlete to train harder and thereby promote greater training adaptations and muscle hypertrophy. 
The only clinically significant side effect occasionally reported from creatine monohydrate supplementation has been the potential for weight gain. 
Although concerns have been raised about the safety and possible side effects of creatine supplementation, multiple shorter and long-term safety studies have reported no apparent side effects and/or that creatine monohydrate may lessen the incidence of injury during training. Consequently, supplementing the diet with creatine monohydrate and/or creatine containing formulations seems to be a safe and effective method to increase muscle mass. 

The ISSN position stand on creatine monohydrate summarizes their findings as this:
- Creatine monohydrate is the most effective ergogenic nutritional supplement currently available to athletes in terms of increasing high-intensity exercise capacity and lean body mass during training.
- Creatine monohydrate supplementation is not only safe, but has been reported to have a number of therapeutic benefits in healthy and diseased populations ranging from infants to the elderly. There is no compelling scientific evidence that the short- or long-term use of creatine monohydrate (up to 30 g/day for 5 years) has any detrimental effects on otherwise healthy individuals or among clinical populations who may benefit from creatine supplementation.
- If proper precautions and supervision are provided, creatine monohydrate supplementation in children and adolescent athletes is acceptable and may provide a nutritional alternative with a favorable safety profile to potentially dangerous anabolic androgenic drugs. However, it is recommended that creatine supplementation only be considered for use by younger athletes who: a) are involved in serious/competitive supervised training; b) are consuming a well-balanced and performance enhancing diet; c) are knowledgeable about the appropriate use of creatine; and d) do not exceed recommended dosages.
- Label advisories on creatine products that caution against usage by those under 18 years old, while perhaps intended to insulate their manufacturers from legal liability, are likely unnecessary given the science supporting creatine’s safety, including in children and adolescents.
- At present, creatine monohydrate is the most extensively studied and clinically effective form of creatine for use in nutritional supplements in terms of muscle uptake and ability to increase high-intensity exercise capacity.
- The addition of carbohydrate or carbohydrate and protein to a creatine supplement appears to increase muscular uptake of creatine, although the effect on performance measures may not be greater than using creatine monohydrate alone.
- The quickest method of increasing muscle creatine stores appears to be to consume ~ 0.3 g/kg/day of creatine monohydrate for 5–7 days followed by 3–5 g/day thereafter to maintain elevated stores. Initially, ingesting smaller amounts of creatine monohydrate (e.g., 3–5 g/day) will increase muscle creatine stores over a three to 4 week period, however, the initial performance effects of this method of supplementation are less supported.
- Clinical populations have been supplemented with high levels of creatine monohydrate (0.3–0.8 g/kg/day equivalent to 21–56 g/day for a 70-kg individual) for years with no clinically significant or serious adverse events.

## Exercise performance
As indicated earlier, creatine supplementation is a well-supported strategy to increase muscle mass and strength during training.
However, creatine has also been reported to improve exercise capacity in a variety of settings. 
Studies have documented improvements in: 
a) single and multiple sprints, 
b) work completed across multiple sets of maximal effort, 
c) anaerobic threshold, 
d) glycogen loading, 
e) work capacity, 
f) recovery, and 
g) greater training tolerance. Consequently, team sports, individual activities or sports that consist of high intensity, intermittent exercise such as soccer, tennis, basketball, lacrosse, field hockey and rugby can all benefit from creatine use
